# Demons & Portals
A minimalistic 3D FPS-puzzle hybrid where the player, a customizable stickman,
explores three levels of increasing difficulty. Inspired by Doom, while puzzles
rely on Portal-style teleportation mechanics. Players collect keys, unlock
chests, gain powerups, and fight enemies (including a boss). The game emphasizes
skillful shooting, puzzle-solving, and speed, and tracks high scores for
replayability.
